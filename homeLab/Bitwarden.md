### Decided to use Vaultwardens self-host, Bitwarden as my password manager.

- Through Docker I ran Vaultwarden.
-  I also registered a subdomain to make everything a tiny bit more clean and tidy though I went with the free option of DuckDNS.( i am a uni student after all ).
-  With the help of chatgpt, i used a script to automate the update of my ip so i dont have to do it manually.
