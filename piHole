## Set up of Pi Hole

- I installed the Pi hole on my rasberry pi and set a static IP address so other devices etc can find it.
- I had to also make the DHCP range shorter on my router so i could set a static IP that other devices wouldnt use.
- I set the DNS server to the pi hole only on my devices as other family member might get annoyed if some website dont display properly...
- Im choosing to go for a more privacy oriented DNS, instead of sending queries to Google. Quad9 and Cloudflare.
- I also enabled live update on the Query Log so its easier to see what get blocked and what not.

//next goal is to make it more secure with https
